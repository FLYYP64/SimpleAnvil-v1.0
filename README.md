# SimpleAnvil-v1.0
Simple plugin upgrades anvil for BOXPVP and SKYGEN servers.
A simple but useful plugin for minecraft servers, especially the BOX PVP and SKYGEN types. 
When you click on the anvil, the gui doesn't open, but part of our level is taken away and the item in our hand is repaired. 
The amount of level taken away can be freely edited in the config.
